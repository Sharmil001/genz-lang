# GenZ Language (genz-lang)
> ⚡ A bold, expressive, Gen Z-inspired programming language for the terminal generation.  
> It’s not just code — it’s a whole damn *vibe*.

`genz-lang` reimagines traditional programming through a Gen Z lens — with slangy keywords, emoji-rich syntax, and natural language expressions.  
Built for fun, education, and creative chaos, this language is for developers who are tired of boring old semicolons and crave a bit of ✨drip✨ in their code.

## 🌈 Why?

Because:
- `print("hello world")` is ✏️ mid — we say `yo "sup world"`
- `else` is old-school — we say `nah:`
- Indexing with `@` hits different than `[0]`
- Errors should feel like being left on read

## 🧠 Designed For:

- Curious devs who love toy languages and creative DSLs
- Educators who want to teach core concepts in a fun way
- Rebels who think `vibe = "chill"` > `let x = "chill"`
